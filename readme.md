### (Yet Another) MEVN Stack

This is a quick project I threw together to model a client/server application using Node/Express/Mongo on the backend and
VueJS for the front end application. The code is split in to two major areas: /client being the front end application written in Vue, /server contains a very simple server app.

### Development
Development requires running the client app `yarn run dev:client` as well as running the server application `yarn run dev:server`. The client application will be listening on port 3001, the server application will be listening on port 3000.
